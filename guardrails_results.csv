q1,What reduction in perplexity did Maia-2 achieve compared to Maia-1?,"Maia-2’s gains in perplexity are similarly striking, reducing average perplexity from a previous record of 4.67 bits down to 4.07 bits.",['Maia-2 Paper'],"Sorry, I cannot answer with sufficient evidence.",16.641222953796387,0.0,0.0
q2,How many positions did Maia-2 treat monotonically in the Grounded Testset?,"In the Grounded Testset of 100K positions, we find that Maia-1 only treats 1% of them monotonically. In stark contrast, however, Maia-2 treats 27% of them monotonically, clearly demonstrating that Maia-2 is much more coherent.",['Maia-2 Paper'],"Sorry, I cannot answer with sufficient evidence.",1.2943480014801025,0.0,0.0
q3,How does Maia-2 compare to Maia-1 in terms of move prediction accuracy?,"Maia-2 demonstrates strong and consistent performance across all skill levels, surpassing all baselines. Specifically, despite Maia-1 models being specifically trained to mimic chess moves by players at specific skill levels, Maia-2 emerges as a unified one-for-all model that is consistently effective across the entire spectrum of chess skills.",['Maia-2 Paper'],"Sorry, I cannot answer with sufficient evidence.",16.503473043441772,0.0,0.0
