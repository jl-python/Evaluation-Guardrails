Maia-1 was developed with. Comparing the two, we see that Maia-2subset matches or outperforms
all baselines and alternate models. Recall that Maia-2 and Maia-2subset don’t have the recent history

people make is of fundamental interest. Can Maia-2 predict mistakes better than Maia-1? Figure 10

Maia-2subset draw from the same source dataset, Maia-2subset can leverage a significantly larger portion
