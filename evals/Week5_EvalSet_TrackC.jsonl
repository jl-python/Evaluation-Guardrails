{"qid": "q1", "query": "What reduction in perplexity did Maia-2 achieve compared to Maia-1?", "gold_answer": "Maia-2\u2019s gains in perplexity are similarly striking, reducing average perplexity from a previous record of 4.67 bits down to 4.07 bits.", "gold_source_ids": ["Maia-2 Paper"]}
{"qid": "q2", "query": "How many positions did Maia-2 treat monotonically in the Grounded Testset?", "gold_answer": "In the Grounded Testset of 100K positions, we find that Maia-1 only treats 1% of them monotonically. In stark contrast, however, Maia-2 treats 27% of them monotonically, clearly demonstrating that Maia-2 is much more coherent.", "gold_source_ids": ["Maia-2 Paper"]}
{"qid": "q3", "query": "How does Maia-2 compare to Maia-1 in terms of move prediction accuracy?", "gold_answer": "Maia-2 demonstrates strong and consistent performance across all skill levels, surpassing all baselines. Specifically, despite Maia-1 models being specifically trained to mimic chess moves by players at specific skill levels, Maia-2 emerges as a unified one-for-all model that is consistently effective across the entire spectrum of chess skills.", "gold_source_ids": ["Maia-2 Paper"]}
{"qid": "q4", "query": "What percentage of positions did Maia-2 treat transitionally?", "gold_answer": "Maia-2 treats substantially more positions transitionally\u2014around 22% of them compared with 17% for Maia.", "gold_source_ids": ["Maia-2 Paper"]}
{"qid": "q5", "query": "What effect does changing one\u2019s own skill have on Maia-2\u2019s decision making compared to changing the opponent\u2019s skill?", "gold_answer": "Changing one\u2019s own skill against a fixed opponent can change the decision up to 22% of the time, but changing the opponent\u2019s skill while fixing our own skill will only change the decision up to 6% of the time.", "gold_source_ids": ["Maia-2 Paper"]}
{"qid": "q6", "query": "What dataset size is reported for Lichess in Table 9?", "gold_answer": "Lichess 19.9 GB 17.5 M Game", "gold_source_ids": ["Chess GPT Paper"]}
{"qid": "q7", "query": "What are the squares the black queen at d8 can legally move to in the Chess state tracking example?", "gold_answer": "Here the black queen at square d8 can be legally moved to any of the squares [\"b8\", \"b6\", \"c7\", \"c8\"].", "gold_source_ids": ["Chess GPT Paper"]}
{"qid": "q8", "query": "What compute resources were used to train ChessGPT-Base?", "gold_answer": "We use 8\u00d780G A100 GPUs for all our experiments. It takes 5 hours to train ChessCLIP using all A100 GPUs. And it takes 60 hours to train ChessGPT-Base model and 18 hours to train ChessGPT-Chat.", "gold_source_ids": ["Chess GPT Paper"]}
{"qid": "q9", "query": "What were the Elo rating results for ChessGPT-Chat in Table 7?", "gold_answer": "ChessGPT-Chat 60.3 \u00b1 1.0", "gold_source_ids": ["Chess GPT Paper"]}
{"qid": "q10", "query": "What limitation was observed in the ChessGPT-Base model\u2019s use of Elo ratings?", "gold_answer": "This suggests that the model\u2019s ability to appropriately incorporate and utilize the Elo ratings during the generation process is not as strong as desired.", "gold_source_ids": ["Chess GPT Paper"]}
{"qid": "q11", "query": "What was the legal move accuracy for Behavioral Cloning in Table A3b?", "gold_answer": "Behavioral Cloning 100.0 99.6 99.5", "gold_source_ids": ["Chess Bench with Stockfish Paper"]}
{"qid": "q12", "query": "What architecture was tested as an alternative to transformers in this benchmark?", "gold_answer": "We therefore train a residual tower with 8 layers and 256 channels (no pooling, broadcasting, or bottleneck layers), followed by a linear layer and a log softmax.", "gold_source_ids": ["Chess Bench with Stockfish Paper"]}
{"qid": "q13", "query": "What conclusion did the authors reach about transformers versus convolutional setups?", "gold_answer": "Thus, the purpose of this experiment is to show that the vanilla transformer setup seems to achieve better performance than an \u201cequivalently vanilla\u201d convolutional setup.", "gold_source_ids": ["Chess Bench with Stockfish Paper"]}
{"qid": "q14", "query": "What do Figures A2 show about overfitting during training?", "gold_answer": "We observe no overfitting, which justifies always using the fully trained model in our evaluations.", "gold_source_ids": ["Chess Bench with Stockfish Paper"]}
{"qid": "q15", "query": "What is the performance of the action-value predictor compared to state-value learning in the long run?", "gold_answer": "Action-value learning (trained on 1.6B action-values) learns slightly slower but outperforms the other two variants in the long run (which are trained on roughly 55M states / best actions).", "gold_source_ids": ["Chess Bench with Stockfish Paper"]}
